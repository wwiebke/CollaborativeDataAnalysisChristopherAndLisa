## Assignment 1
Quote from the syllabus: "The first pair assignment is designed to develop your understanding of file structures, version 
control, and basic R data structures and transformations. Each pair will create a new public GitHub repository. The repository should be fully documented, including with an informative README.md file. The repository will include R source code files that access at least two core R data sets, perform basic transformations on the data, and illustrate the distribution of the data 
using a variety of descriptive statistics. At least one file must dynamically link to another in a substantively meaningful way. Deadline: 2 October, 10% of final grade."
